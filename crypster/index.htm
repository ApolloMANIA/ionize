		<h3>Prepare yourself, for I shall weave a tale of terror and forbidden knowledge:</h3><br>

Within this ghastly realm, rules dissolve into darkness, leaving you adrift in a chilling abyss. Proceed to the next screen, one step closer to your inevitable fate upon the end screen. But beware, for there is a single rule that binds you: never shall you seek solace in the web's dark corners, for walkthroughs are the poison that shall extinguish the flickering flame of enjoyment. This is the essence of our wicked game, where misery and delight entwine.

		ok enough chat gpt, this is too cringe.

		<br>
		<br>
        - no capital letters<br>
        - the passphrase will never be something obvious and will require your thinking.<br>

        - passphrases usually contain 1 to 3 words<br>
